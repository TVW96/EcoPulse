# Large Language Model Eliminator (LLMinator)

#### Overview
Built as a tool for exploratory learning and testing, the app will offer a streamlined way to evaluate how different models interpret, respond to, and reason through user input. By abstracting away the complexity of traditional chat UIs and focusing on the simplicity of text messaging, it enables developers to prototype model routing logic, compare outputs in real time, and analyze the behavioral differences between popular LLMs like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

Whether used for academic research, ethical inquiry, or just entertaining banter with models of varied “personalities,” the app facilitates deeper understanding of model design, limitations, and conversational affordances—one SMS at a time.
